// Hooks are directly connected to Fiber Nodes.
// Hook is almost like attaching something to the branch of a tree,
// React has Hooks as something that is hanging off the Nodes.
// A hook is a javascript object -- A hook has its own state and a Queue
/**
 * It has a State and a Queue and a hook of its own. Each Fiber Node can have one or more hooks. Hooks are attached to Nodes of a tree. A linkedList is a type of data structure that links one Node to another. (Head to Tail).
 */
// You can build a queue using a LinkedList
